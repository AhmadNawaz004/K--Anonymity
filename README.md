# K--Anonymity
A popular approach for data anonymization is k-anonymity.  With k-anonymity an original data set containing personal health information can be transformed so that it is difficult for an intruder to determine the identity of the individuals in that data set. A k-anonymized data set has the property that each record is similar to at least another k-1 other records on the potentially identifying variables. For example, if k = 5 and the potentially identifying variables are age and gender, then a k-anonymized data set has at least 5 records for each value combination of age and gender. The most common implementations of k-anonymity use transformation techniques such as generalization, global recoding, and suppression
